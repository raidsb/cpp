/*
C++ has a set of fundamental types corresponding to the most common basic storage units of a
computer and the most common ways of using them to hold data :
1- A Boolean type(bool)
2- Character types(such as char and wchar_t)
3- Integer types(such as int and long long)
4- Floating - point types(such as double and long double)
5- A type, void, used to signify the absence of information
bool, char, and integer types are called "integral types" 
"integral types" and floating are called "arithmatic types"

From these types, we can construct other types using declarator operators :
6- Pointer types(such as int∗)
7- Array types(such as char[])
8- Reference types(such as double& and vector<int>&&)

In addition, a user can define additional types :
9- Data structures and classes(Chapter 16)
10- Enumeration types for representing specific sets of values(enum and enum class
